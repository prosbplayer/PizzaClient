All macros have failsafes, for example player detection or stop when getting warped out -Auto Enchanting -Auto Book Combine -Auto Salvage -Shoot terminator when left clicking with valk -Gemstone ESP -Hide Golden Goblins -Powder Chest Macro (there's also a mode to only use fake rotation to solve it) -Item Keybinds -Commission Esps -Alot of dungeon Esps -Auto Wardrobe -Anti sessionid stealer (works for getSessionID and getToken, still somewhat WIP?)
